  Extension for Chromium-based browsers to monitor fun statistics about your daily web activity
</p>

## How it works
Dumb Stats tracks user actions such as clicking, scrolling, typing, and opening pages and calculates
<br> fun statistics about these actions. You can know:
- How many calories you burn by clicking a mouse;
- How many meters of web pages you scroll every day;
- What novel you could have typed with your number of keypresses;
- How much time approximately you have spent browsing internet.
